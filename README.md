<h2>
  Overview
</h2>

<p class="lh-default">Typohacko is a simple typing game, which combines two element of a speed typer game and shooting components. <br> <br>
I've wanted to create a game that involves two game types and combine them into one. Those were such cool things I'd like try. When I started working on this project, I realized that my knowledge of JavaScript was very basic. It was such a scary feeling to start as I did not know much on where and how to. The feelings and efforts I tried to find on the internet were quite exhausting. Fortunately, I found some solutions from questions that I had in mind along my journey and pretty much developed my knowledge on my JavaScript skill.</p> <p>PS: <em>It's my very first game and I know it needs a lot more stuffs ðŸ˜…</em></p>

<br>
<h2>So how does it work?</h2>
<p>The game is simply made by <strong>HTML, CSS and JavaScript </strong><em>(as stated above)</em> It has a simple markup in HTML which defines almost every needs such as header, main content, links and footer. The CSS part is responsible for the layout of the game page such as graphics and user interfaces. JavaScript is for the DOM (Document Object Model), interactions, visuals and logics. Since I'm making a simple game as my first project, I based on what I experienced and from my knowledge, to create a minimal yet direct, click and play type game.</p>
