<h2>
  Overview
</h2>

<p class="lh-default">Typohacko is a simple typing game, which combines two element of a speed typer game and shooting components. <br> <br>
I've wanted to create a game that involves two game types and combine them into one. Those were such cool things I'd like try. When I started working on this project, I realized that my knowledge of JavaScript was very basic. It was such a scary feeling to start as I did not know much on where and how to. The feelings and efforts I tried to find on the internet were quite exhausting. Fortunately, I found some solutions from questions that I had in mind along my journey and pretty much developed my knowledge on my JavaScript skill.</p>
