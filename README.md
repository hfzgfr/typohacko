<h2>
  Overview
</h2>

<p class="lh-default">Typohacko is a simple typing game, which combines two element of a speed typer game and shooting components. <br> <br>
I've wanted to create a game that involves two game types and combine them into one. Those were such cool things I'd like try. When I started working on this project, I realized that my knowledge of JavaScript was very basic. It was such a scary feeling to start as I did not know much on where and how to. The feelings and efforts I tried to find on the internet were quite exhausting. Fortunately, I found some solutions from questions that I had in mind along my journey and pretty much developed my knowledge on my JavaScript skill.</p> <p>PS: <em>It's my very first game and I know it needs a lot more stuffs 😅</em></p>

<br>
<h2>So how does it work?</h2>
<p>The game is simply made by HTML, CSS and JavaScript<em>(as stated above)</em></p>
